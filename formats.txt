listening to this sick song: '{track}' - {artist}
hey, '{track}' by {artist} is pretty rad
can't stop humming '{track}' by {artist}, i hate it
anyone else heard '{track}'? crushing on {artist} rn
have listened to '{track}' by {artist} like a million times now
tbh {artist} turns me on a bit with '{track}'
